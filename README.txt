Welcome To Password Hacker by HYPERSKILL.
--> This Project Focused on working with iterators, generators and itertools module, it also allowed me to practice developing a client app and connecting to a server using the socket module.
--> It started with simply establishing a connection, then elevated to Dictionary based Brute Force, arriving to catching Exceptions in the responses from the socket, to finally using a time based vulnerability.
--> This Project is executable only with automated Hyperskill Correction Algorithms as they provide they appropriate "IP adress" and "Port"
